+ Project summary: In this project, we seek to build a shiny app that would recommend movies to users based on two different methods: 
     <br/>
     + a. More direct method: Use a KDTree classifier that we built using the data and additional features, we will recommend 4 movies based on one particular favorite movie of the user.  
     <br/>
     
     + b.More indirect method: Using “psychological analysis”, we will recommend a few movies based on what picture, what colour, and what poetic line the user chooses.
